The keywords work the same as in Python.
### Break
Instead of ```break```, ```exit``` is used.
```text 
var x = 0
while (true)
	if (x > 5)
		exit >> will exit loop
	x = x + 1
end
```

### Continue
Instead of ```continue```, ```skip``` is used.
```text 
var x = 0
while (x < 10)
	if (x > 5)
		skip >> skip the lines below (the 'x = x + 1')
	x = x + 1
end
```

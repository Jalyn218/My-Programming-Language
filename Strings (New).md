This section contains everything you need to know about strings and how to manipulate them. Much like the other aspects of this language, how strings work is similar to Python -  this only difference is the syntax. 

## Convert a string to lower or upper case
```text
var my_string = "Hello World!"

var my_string_upper = my_string.upper_case()
display("Upper case:", my_string_upper) >> HELLO WORLD!

var my_string_lower = my_string.lower_case()
display("Lower case:", my_string_lower) >> hello world!

```
